## Ultra Widescreen and Co-op UI Fixes (Updated version)

Allows switching to vertical splitscreen.
Allows to use inventory and trade screens when playing in co-op using multi monitor setup.
Moves map and loading screens to the 1st player's screen, so they're not split between monitors.

The mod should also fix ui scaling when not using splitscreen, for example when playing on ultrawide displays - UI should not be weirdly large.

### Controls

* Home + H - enable/refresh horizontal splitscreen
* Home + V - enable/refresh vertical splitscreen
* Home + M - toggle moving global UIs to 1st player view (for multi monitor split mode).
* Home + NumPlus - make UI larger
* Home + NumMinus - make UI smaller
* Home + Num* - reset UI scale back to 1

Some hotkey actions happen/settle only after the release of Home button.
It's a very early version, so please report any issues/suggestions.

All credits remain to SirMuffin9, I have just fixed a minor API change to make this mod work again.

_I'll remove this version once the author has fixed his own one._
