## Linked Stash Chests

This mod links together all stash chests so you don't have to pack like a mule.

To link stash chests it is obviously necessary for this mod to handle items. Items are handled in a safe manner, but to be absolutely safe you may want to back up your SaveGames folder in the Outward installation folder.

This mod took a lot of work to get right. If you love it, consider supporting the author on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/stianhoiland).

### Updater's notes

* **Backup** your `SaveGames` folder **before** installing this mod
* I **won't** recommend the use of this mod since
  * it modifies on the fly your savegame which could lead to corrupted data
  * it has a huge negative impact on performance since it loads more files than necessary

### Credits

All credits remain to Stian, I have just fixed a breaking API change to make this mod work again

_I'll remove this version once the author has fixed his own one._
